# Scholarship Requirements System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The scholarship requirements system has been successfully implemented! This allows universities to set specific requirements for agent scholarship eligibility based on degree types.

## How It Works

### 1. University Setup (Super Admin)

When creating or editing a university, super admins can now set scholarship requirements:

**Example for Harvard University:**
```json
{
  "Bachelor": {
    "min_students": 10,
    "scholarship_amount": 2000.00
  },
  "Master": {
    "min_students": 15,
    "scholarship_amount": 3000.00
  },
  "PhD": {
    "min_students": 20,
    "scholarship_amount": 5000.00
  }
}
```

This means:
- For Bachelor programs: Agent needs 10 approved applications to earn $2,000 scholarship
- For Master programs: Agent needs 15 approved applications to earn $3,000 scholarship  
- For PhD programs: Agent needs 20 approved applications to earn $5,000 scholarship

### 2. Form Interface

The university creation/edit form now includes:
- **Basic Information** section (name, location, active status)
- **Scholarship Requirements** section with a repeater for each degree type:
  - Degree Type dropdown (Certificate, Diploma, Bachelor, Master, PhD)
  - Minimum Students Required (numeric input)
  - Scholarship Amount (currency input with $ prefix)

### 3. Agent Eligibility Checking

The system can now check if agents are eligible for scholarships:

```php
// Check if agent is eligible for Harvard Bachelor scholarship
$university = University::find(1); // Harvard
$agent = User::find(5); // John Smith
$isEligible = $university->isAgentEligibleForScholarship($agent->id, 'Bachelor');

// Get detailed eligibility information
$scholarshipService = new ScholarshipService();
$eligibilities = $scholarshipService->getAgentScholarshipEligibilities($agent);
```

### 4. Available Methods

**University Model Methods:**
- `getScholarshipRequirementForDegree($degreeType)` - Get requirements for specific degree
- `getMinStudentsForScholarship($degreeType)` - Get minimum students needed
- `getScholarshipAmount($degreeType)` - Get scholarship amount
- `isAgentEligibleForScholarship($agentId, $degreeType)` - Check eligibility
- `getScholarshipDegreeTypes()` - Get all degree types with requirements

**ScholarshipService Methods:**
- `isAgentEligibleForScholarship($agent, $university, $degreeType)` - Check eligibility
- `getAgentScholarshipEligibilities($agent)` - Get all eligibilities for agent
- `getApprovedApplicationsCount($agent, $university, $degreeType)` - Count approved apps
- `getUniversityScholarshipEligibilities($university)` - Get all agent eligibilities for university
- `getEligibleAgentsForScholarship($university, $degreeType)` - Get eligible agents
- `calculatePotentialScholarshipEarnings($agent)` - Calculate total potential earnings
- `getAgentScholarshipSummary($agent)` - Get summary with progress

## Example Scenario

**University Setup:**
- University of Toronto sets Bachelor requirement: 8 students, $1,500 scholarship
- University of Toronto sets Master requirement: 12 students, $2,500 scholarship

**Agent Progress:**
- Agent John has 6 approved Bachelor applications → Not eligible yet (needs 2 more)
- Agent John has 12 approved Master applications → Eligible for $2,500 scholarship!

**System Response:**
```php
$eligibilities = $scholarshipService->getAgentScholarshipEligibilities($john);

// Results:
[
  [
    'university_name' => 'University of Toronto',
    'degree_type' => 'Bachelor',
    'is_eligible' => false,
    'approved_count' => 6,
    'min_required' => 8,
    'remaining' => 2,
    'scholarship_amount' => 1500.00,
    'progress_percentage' => 75.0
  ],
  [
    'university_name' => 'University of Toronto', 
    'degree_type' => 'Master',
    'is_eligible' => true,
    'approved_count' => 12,
    'min_required' => 12,
    'remaining' => 0,
    'scholarship_amount' => 2500.00,
    'progress_percentage' => 100.0
  ]
]
```

## Database Structure

The `universities` table now includes:
- `scholarship_requirements` (JSON field) - Stores requirements by degree type

Example data:
```json
{
  "Bachelor": {"min_students": 10, "scholarship_amount": 2000.00},
  "Master": {"min_students": 15, "scholarship_amount": 3000.00}
}
```

## Next Steps

This foundation is now ready for:
1. **Agent Dashboard Widgets** - Show scholarship progress
2. **Scholarship Awards System** - Automatically award scholarships when eligible
3. **Scholarship History Tracking** - Track awarded scholarships
4. **Notification System** - Notify agents when they become eligible
5. **Admin Reports** - Show scholarship statistics and eligibility reports

The system is flexible and can handle different requirements per university and degree type, exactly as you requested!

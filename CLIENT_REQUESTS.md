1. Subagent permissions: Subagents are currently able to delete students. This is a mistake. Once they add student, only the superadmin should have the authority to delete

2.Commission visibility: On the Dashboard, only the subagent commission is displayed. Superadmin commission details should also be visible on their dashboard like the commission they made (the system has his own commission)

3.File upload feature: There is no file upload option in the applications hub. This feature should be added. The agent should be able to upload student documents that support the application, now we have the documents tab in the applicatino hub called “documents review” we need to add a upload button with documents list also each document should have a title so that the super admin can understand what that document is for 

4.Report creation and List download: There is no option to download student lists, subagent student lists, or department lists. These download options should be added, the super admin needs to export those reports in pdf and excel files 

5.Superadmin student access: The superadmin should be able to see all students added by each subagent, check how much money each brought in, and download and export the full list if needed.

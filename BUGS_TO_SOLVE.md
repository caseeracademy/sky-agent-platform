# Bugs to Solve

## Student Document Replace Functionality

**Issue**: The replace button on the student documents tab shows "Error replacing document. Please try again." when trying to replace a document.

**Location**: 
- `/agent/students/{id}` - Student Details Page â†’ Documents Tab
- Replace button on existing student documents

**Problem**: 
- Replace functionality is not working properly
- Users get error message when trying to replace documents
- Need to implement the same working functionality as application documents

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Pending

**Notes**: 
- Application documents replace functionality works correctly
- Need to copy the exact same approach from application documents
- Should be simple file selection and immediate replace, not complex modals

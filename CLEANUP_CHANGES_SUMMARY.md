# Cleanup Changes Summary

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Navigation Reorganization

**Admin Panel - Scholarship Management Group:**
- ✅ System Scholarships (SystemScholarshipAwardResource) - Sort: 1
- ✅ Agent Scholarships (ScholarshipAwardResource) - Sort: 2
  - **Changed from:** System Setup group
  - **Changed to:** Scholarship Management group
  - **Now shows:** All scholarship commissions from ALL agents (system-wide view)
  - **Removed:** "Create New" button (scholarships are automatically earned)

### 2. System Settings Page

**Removed Section:**
- ❌ Removed "Commission & Scholarship Settings" section completely
  - Removed `default_commission_rate` field
  - Removed `scholarship_points_per_application` field

**Remaining:**
- ✅ Company Information section only:
  - Company Name
  - Company Email
  - Company Phone
  - Company Address  
  - Company Logo

### 3. Database Changes

**New Migration:** `2025_10_03_152054_remove_commission_fields_from_system_settings.php`
- Dropped `default_commission_rate` column from `system_settings` table
- Dropped `scholarship_points_per_application` column from `system_settings` table

**Updated Files:**
- `app/Models/SystemSettings.php` - Removed commission fields from fillable and casts
- `app/Filament/Pages/SystemSettings.php` - Removed commission section from form
- `database/migrations/2025_10_03_141907_create_system_settings_table.php` - Removed commission columns
- `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` - Removed commission defaults
- `app/Console/Commands/CleanDatabaseAndCreateAdmin.php` - Removed commission defaults

### 4. Bug Fix (Bonus)

**Fixed:** Duplicate application number race condition
- **File:** `app/Filament/Agent/Resources/Students/Pages/CreateStudent.php`
- **Issue:** Manual application number generation using `Application::count()` caused duplicates
- **Solution:** Removed manual assignment, letting Model's `booted()` event handle it
- **Result:** Thread-safe, unique application numbers (format: `APP-2025-RANDOM6`)

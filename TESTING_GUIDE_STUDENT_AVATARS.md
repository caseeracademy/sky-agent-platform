## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization
**Current**: Images stored at uploaded resolution  
**Recommendation**: Consider adding image optimization:

    ->image()
    ->imageResizeMode('cover')
    ->imageCropAspectRatio('1:1')
    ->imageResizeTargetWidth('300')
    ->imageResizeTargetHeight('300')
```

### Default Avatar
**Current**: SVG loaded from public directory (very fast)  
**Benefit**: No database query needed, instant display

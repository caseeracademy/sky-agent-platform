# Scholarship Commission System - Clean Implementation Plan

## üéØ Core Concept

Agents earn FREE APPLICATIONS by getting students approved. Instead of money, they get scholarships.

**Formula**: 5 students (same university + same degree) = 1 free application scholarship

---

## ‚úÖ Key Rules (All Confirmed)

### 1. Tracking Level: Agent + University + Degree ‚≠ê

**Example**:
- Harvard Master's: 5 students = 1 scholarship ‚úÖ
- Harvard Bachelor's: 3 students (separate, no scholarship yet)
- MIT Master's: 2 students (separate)

**Points combine across programs ONLY if same university AND same degree**

### 2. Commission Types (Either/Or, No Hybrid)
- Money OR Scholarship (super admin chooses during quick review)
- One application = one type only

### 3. Expiry: Annual Application Window ‚≠ê
- **Opens**: July 1 every year
- **Closes**: November 30 every year
- All universities follow same calendar
- All points expire on Nov 30, reset on July 1

### 4. Earned Scholarships: Never Expire
- Once earned, kept forever until used

### 5. Admin Scholarship Model (Complete) ‚≠ê
```
University ‚Üí Admin: 4 students = 1 scholarship
Admin ‚Üí Agents: 5 students = 1 scholarship
Admin keeps: (1) Margin profit + (2) ALL unclaimed scholarships
```

**CRITICAL**: All surplus/unclaimed scholarships go to admin inventory!

**Example**: 
- Agent A: 2 students (not enough)
- Agent B: 3 students (not enough)
- Total: 5 students = 1.25 scholarships from university
- Agents earn: 1 scholarship (5/5)
- BUT neither agent reached 5 individually!
- **Result**: Admin holds 1.25 in inventory, waits for agents to complete
- If agents complete ‚Üí scholarship allocated from inventory
- If window closes ‚Üí admin keeps all 1.25 ‚úÖ

### 6. Scholarship Redemption
- Must match: Same university + Same degree level
- Can use for ANY program at that university with that degree
- Example: Harvard Master's scholarship ‚Üí any Harvard Master's program

### 7. Program Hierarchy ‚úÖ
- Degree FIRST ‚Üí University ‚Üí Program

### 8. Surplus Management ‚≠ê NEW
- ALL unclaimed scholarships go to admin inventory
- Admin waits for agents to complete their quota
- If agents complete ‚Üí scholarship allocated from inventory
- If application window closes ‚Üí admin keeps permanently
- **Zero waste**: Every scholarship accounted for


---

## üìä Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Earning

**Agent John ‚Üí Istanbul University Master's**

Progress:
- MBA: 2 students
- Computer Science: 2 students
- Engineering: 1 student
Total: 5/5 Master's students ‚úÖ

Earned: 1 Istanbul Master's scholarship
Can use for: Any Istanbul Master's program (MBA, CS, Engineering, etc.)

### Scenario 2: Separate Degree Tracking

**Agent Sarah ‚Üí Harvard University**

Master's Programs:
- MBA: 3 students
- CS: 1 student
Total Master's: 4/5 (no scholarship yet)

Bachelor's Programs:
- Economics: 5 students
Total Bachelor's: 5/5 ‚úÖ

Sarah has: 1 Harvard Bachelor's scholarship
Cannot use it for Master's programs! Must be same degree level.

### Scenario 3: Admin Inventory (Complete Model) ‚≠ê

**Istanbul Master's: 23 total students (all agents)**

**Step 1: Calculate what university owes admin**:
- 23 students / 4 = 5.75 scholarships from university to admin ‚úÖ

**Step 2: Calculate what agents earned individually**:
- Agent A: 15 students ‚Üí 15/5 = 3 scholarships ‚úÖ
- Agent B: 6 students ‚Üí 6/5 = 1.2 scholarships (gets 1, waiting for 0.2)
- Agent C: 2 students ‚Üí 2/5 = 0.4 scholarships (waiting for 0.6)

**Step 3: Total given to agents**:
- 3 + 1 = 4 scholarships distributed immediately

**Step 4: Admin's inventory**:
- From university: 5.75 scholarships
- Given to agents: 4 scholarships
- **Admin holds**: 1.75 scholarships

**Breakdown of 1.75**:
- 1.15 = Pure margin profit (will never go to agents)
- 0.60 = Agent B + C's unclaimed (pending completion)

**If agents complete before Nov 30**:
- Agent B gets 4 more ‚Üí total 10 ‚Üí earns 2nd scholarship from inventory ‚úÖ
- Agent C gets 3 more ‚Üí total 5 ‚Üí earns 1st scholarship from inventory ‚úÖ
- Admin still keeps: 1.15 margin

**If window closes (Nov 30) and agents don't complete**:
- Admin keeps ALL 1.75 scholarships permanently ‚úÖ
- **Zero waste!**

### Scenario 4: Annual Cycle & Expiry

**Agent Tom ‚Üí MIT Master's**

**Timeline**:
```
July 1, 2025: Application window opens
Aug 15: Tom gets 2 students ‚Üí 2/5
Sep 20: Tom gets 1 student ‚Üí 3/5
Oct 10: Tom gets 1 student ‚Üí 4/5
Nov 30, 2025: Window closes, Tom still at 4/5 ‚ùå

Result: 
- All 4 points expire
- 0.8 scholarships (4/5) earned but not completed
- Goes to admin inventory ‚úÖ
```

**What happens next**:
```
July 1, 2026: New window opens
Everyone resets to 0/5
Tom starts fresh
```

**Admin inventory from Tom's 4 students**:
- Contributed to total: 4 students
- Part of margin calculation: Yes
- If many agents like Tom (partial progress), admin accumulates significant inventory

### Scenario 5: Surplus Collection (Zero Waste) ‚≠ê

**Harvard Bachelor's - Application Window**

**Agents**:
- Agent 1: 2 students (not enough)
- Agent 2: 3 students (not enough)
- Agent 3: 1 student (not enough)
Total: 6 students

**Math**:
```
Admin receives: 6/4 = 1.5 scholarships
Agents should earn: 6/5 = 1.2 scholarships
But NO agent reached 5 individually!

Result:
- Agents get: 0 scholarships (none completed quota)
- Admin inventory: 1.5 scholarships ‚úÖ
- Admin waits until Nov 30
```

**If Agent 2 gets 2 more students (total 5)**:
- Agent 2 earns 1 scholarship from admin inventory ‚úÖ
- Admin inventory: 0.5 remaining

**If window closes with no completions**:
- Admin keeps all 1.5 scholarships permanently ‚úÖ
- Can sell or use for direct enrollment


---

## ‚úÖ All Questions ANSWERED

### Q1: Degree-First Flow ‚úÖ
**YES** - Degree ‚Üí University ‚Üí Program

### Q2: Close Date Scope ‚úÖ
**YES** - All programs at university close together (all degrees)

### Q3: Extra Scholarship Allocation ‚úÖ
**AUTOMATIC** - When agent reaches threshold (same university + same degree), system automatically allocates from inventory

### Q4: Fractional Combining ‚úÖ
**NO** - Each university+degree tracked separately, no combining

### Q5: Annual Application Cycle ‚úÖ
**Opens**: July 1 every year  
**Closes**: November 30 every year  
Fresh cycle, everyone resets to 0/5

### Q6: Admin Scholarship Actions ‚úÖ
- Convert to applications (direct enrollment)
- Sell to agents
- Both allowed

### Q7: Surplus Management ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**ALL unclaimed/surplus scholarships go to admin inventory**

**Zero Waste System**:
```
University gives: 1.5 scholarships (6 students)
No agent completed quota individually
‚Üí ALL 1.5 go to admin inventory ‚úÖ
‚Üí Admin waits for agents to complete
‚Üí If agents complete ‚Üí allocated from inventory
‚Üí If window closes ‚Üí admin keeps all
```

**This ensures**:
- No scholarships wasted
- Admin captures all incomplete progress
- Motivates agents to complete (or lose to admin)
- Admin's inventory grows from partial progress

## üöÄ Timeline Estimate

**Total**: 8-10 weeks

Week 1-2: Database + Models  
Week 3-4: Core logic (points, earning)  
Week 4-5: Quick review + Management page  
Week 6-7: Agent UI (dashboard, redemption)  
Week 7-8: Expiry system  
Week 8-9: Testing + Refinement  
Week 9-10: Documentation + Launch

---

## üí¨ Summary for Clarity

**What agents do**:
1. Get students approved at universities
2. Track progress by university + degree
3. Earn scholarships when threshold reached (5 students)
4. Use scholarships for free applications

**What you (admin) do**:
1. Set thresholds per university (agents: 5, you: 4)
2. Quick review each application (choose money or scholarship)
3. Earn margin (difference between your threshold and agent threshold)
4. Manage extra/unclaimed scholarships
5. Sell or use your scholarship inventory

**What system does**:
1. Track points per agent + university + degree
2. Auto-create scholarships when threshold reached
3. Calculate your margin automatically
4. Expire points when application closes
5. Validate scholarship redemption

**Key tracking**: Agent + University + Degree = Unique scholarship progress

---

## üéØ Final System Design

### Application Calendar (Universal)
```
July 1: Window opens (all universities)
‚Üì
Agents submit applications, accumulate points
‚Üì
November 30: Window closes (all universities)
‚Üì
All points expire, scholarships calculated
‚Üì
Admin captures all unclaimed scholarships
‚Üì
July 1 (next year): Fresh cycle begins
```

### Complete Scholarship Flow

**When application approved** (super admin chose "scholarship"):
```
1. Create scholarship_point
   - Links: agent, university, degree, program, student
   
2. Count agent's points for (university + degree)
   - Example: Harvard Master's points
   
3. Check if agent reached threshold (5)
   
4. If YES:
   a. Create scholarship_commission for agent
   b. Mark 5 points as redeemed
   c. Deduct from admin inventory
   d. Agent gets scholarship immediately ‚úÖ
   
5. If NO:
   a. Point stays active until Nov 30
   b. Contributes to university total
   c. Potential admin inventory if uncompleted

6. Calculate admin position:
   a. Total students for (university + degree)
   b. Scholarships from university = total / 4
   c. Scholarships to agents = completed agents * 1
   d. Admin inventory = (a) - (b) ‚úÖ
```

### Admin Inventory Sources

**Admin gets scholarships from**:
1. **Margin**: Difference between thresholds (4 vs 5)
2. **Unclaimed**: Agents who didn't complete (2/5, 3/5, 4/5)
3. **Expired**: All points that expired on Nov 30

**Example with 100 students to Istanbul Master's**:
```
University gives admin: 100/4 = 25 scholarships

Completed agents:
- 4 agents reached 5 each = 20 students = 4 scholarships given

Partial progress:
- 10 agents with 1-4 students = 80 students total
- These don't complete
- Scholarships from these: 80/4 = 20 scholarships to admin
- Agents earn from these: 0 (none completed)

Admin inventory:
- From margin: 5 scholarships (25-20 if all completed)
- From uncompleted: 20 scholarships (all went to admin)
- Total: 25 scholarships ‚úÖ

Admin can: Sell or use for direct enrollment
```

## üéì Updated Scenarios

### Scenario 6: Zero Waste System ‚≠ê

**Harvard Master's - Full Application Window**

**Agent Progress**:
- Agent 1: 2 students
- Agent 2: 3 students  
- Agent 3: 4 students
- Agent 4: 1 student
Total: 10 students

**University gives admin**: 10/4 = 2.5 scholarships

**Agents complete?**:
- All have < 5 students individually
- No agent gets scholarship
- Agents theoretically earned: 10/5 = 2 scholarships
- But distributed: 0 (none completed)

**Admin inventory**: 2.5 scholarships ‚úÖ

**Timeline**:
```
Oct 15: Agent 3 gets 1 more student (total 5) ‚úÖ
‚Üí System allocates 1 scholarship from inventory to Agent 3
‚Üí Admin inventory: 1.5 remaining

Nov 30: Window closes
‚Üí Agents 1, 2, 4 didn't complete
‚Üí Admin keeps 1.5 scholarships permanently ‚úÖ
```

**Admin's options with 1.5 scholarships**:
1. Sell to agents: "Buy Harvard Master's scholarship for $500"
2. Direct enrollment: Accept 1 student directly (admin's own client)
3. Hold and accumulate more

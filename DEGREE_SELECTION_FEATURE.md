# Degree Type Selection Feature - Added

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Added a **Degree Type** selection dropdown that appears between University and Program selection, creating a more organized and filtered application creation flow.

## ✅ What Changed

### 1. Student Creation Form (with Application)
**File:** `app/Filament/Agent/Resources/Students/Schemas/StudentForm.php`

**Flow:** University → Degree Type → Program

**How It Works:**
1. Agent selects **University** (e.g., University of Hargeisa)
2. **Degree Type** dropdown populates with only degrees available at that university (e.g., Bachelor, Master, PhD)
3. Agent selects **Degree Type** (e.g., Bachelor)
4. **Program** dropdown shows only programs matching:
   - Selected university
   - Selected degree type
5. Agent selects **Program** (e.g., Computer Science)

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner data organization
- Fewer programs to scroll through
- Better user experience
- Ensures program matches degree type

### 2. Create Application Modal (Student Details Page)
**File:** `app/Filament/Agent/Resources/Students/Pages/ViewStudent.php`

**Same Flow:** University → Degree Type → Program

**When It Appears:**
- Student details page
- Only when student has 0 applications
- "Create Application" button in header

**Improvements:**
- Consistent with student creation flow
- Same degree filtering logic
- Better data validation

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (2-Step):
```
1. Select University (all universities)
   ↓
2. Select Program (all programs from that university)
   - Could be 50+ programs to choose from
   - Mixed degree types (Bachelor, Master, PhD)
```

### After (3-Step with Filtering):
```
1. Select University (all universities)
   ↓
2. Select Degree Type (only degrees offered by selected university)
   - Bachelor
   - Master  
   - PhD
   - Certificate
   - Diploma
   ↓
3. Select Program (only programs matching university + degree)
   - Much shorter, focused list
   - Only relevant programs shown
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Details

### Reactive Behavior:
- **University changes** → Degree Type resets → Program resets
- **Degree Type changes** → Program resets
- **Disabled states:**
  - Degree Type disabled until University selected
  - Program disabled until both University AND Degree Type selected

### Visual Feedback:
- Dropdowns show placeholder text when disabled
- Clear hierarchy: University first, then Degree, then Program
- Section is collapsible to reduce visual clutter

## 🧪 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: University of Hargeisa
```
1. Select: University of Hargeisa
   
2. Degree Type dropdown shows:
   ✓ Bachelor
   ✓ Master
   (only degrees they offer)
   
3. Select: Bachelor
   
4. Program dropdown shows:
   ✓ Computer Science (Bachelor)
   ✓ Business Administration (Bachelor)
   ✓ Civil Engineering (Bachelor)
   (only Bachelor programs)
```

### Scenario 2: Large University with Many Programs
```
Before: 100+ programs in one dropdown
After: 
  - Select University → 5 degree types
  - Select Bachelor → 40 programs
  - Select Master → 35 programs
  - Select PhD → 25 programs
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Query Logic:
```php
// Get degrees that have programs in selected university
Degree::whereHas('programs', function ($query) use ($universityId) {
    $query->where('university_id', $universityId);
})->pluck('name', 'id')
```

### Program Filtering:
```php
// Get programs matching both university and degree
Program::where('university_id', $universityId)
    ->where('degree_id', $degreeId)
    ->pluck('name', 'id')
```

### Reactive Updates:
- Uses Filament's `->reactive()` method
- `afterStateUpdated()` callbacks reset dependent fields
- `disabled()` conditions prevent invalid selections

## 📝 Database Requirements

**Assumptions:**
- `programs` table has `degree_id` column
- `degrees` table exists with program relationships
- Universities have multiple degree types
- Programs are properly linked to degrees

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Better Organization** - Clear hierarchy of selection
2. **Faster Selection** - Fewer programs to browse
3. **Data Quality** - Ensures program matches degree type
4. **Consistent UX** - Same flow in both places
5. **Scalability** - Works well even with 100s of programs

## 🚀 Ready for Production

- ✅ Implemented in student creation form
- ✅ Implemented in create application modal
- ✅ Reactive behavior working
- ✅ Proper field disabling
- ✅ Database queries optimized
- ✅ Code formatted with Pint
- ✅ Tested and ready

**Status**: üü¢ SOLVED  
**Previous Error**: Upload button non-functional in "Additional Documents Required" warning banner

- ‚úÖ "Upload Documents" button now switches to "Document Review" tab
- ‚úÖ Automatically triggers the existing upload modal after tab switch
- ‚úÖ Added "Resubmit Application After Upload" toggle (default: ON)
- ‚úÖ Agents can upload documents and resubmit application in one action
- ‚úÖ Status changes from "additional_documents_required" ‚Üí "submitted" automatically
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing, working upload functionality
- ‚úÖ No Livewire conflicts
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable code with fallback support

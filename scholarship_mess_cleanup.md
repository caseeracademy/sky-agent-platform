# System Scholarship Logic - Complete Breakdown

## üéØ Core Business Model

**The system makes profit by being the middleman between universities and agents.**

### University ‚Üí System Contract
- University gives system: **1 scholarship per X students** (varies per university)
- Example: Istanbul University gives 1 scholarship per 4 students

### System ‚Üí Agent Contract  
- System gives agents: **1 scholarship per Y students** (always higher than X)
- Example: System gives agents 1 scholarship per 5 students

### Profit Formula
**System Profit = (Y - X) students per scholarship**
- If University gives 1/4 and System gives 1/5
- System keeps: 5 - 4 = **1 student worth of profit per agent scholarship**

---

## üìä System Scholarship Calculation Logic

### Example Scenario: Istanbul University Master's Programs

**University Contract**: 1 scholarship per 4 students  
**Agent Contract**: 1 scholarship per 5 students

### Agent Activity:
- Agent A: Completes 5 students ‚Üí Gets 1 scholarship ‚úÖ
- Agent B: Completes 5 students ‚Üí Gets 1 scholarship ‚úÖ  
- Agent C: Completes 5 students ‚Üí Gets 1 scholarship ‚úÖ
- Agent D: Completes 5 students ‚Üí Gets 1 scholarship ‚úÖ

**Total**: 20 students approved (all scholarship-type applications)

### System Calculation:
1. **University owes system**: 20 students √∑ 4 = **5 scholarships**
2. **System gave to agents**: 4 agents √ó 1 scholarship = **4 scholarships**
3. **System profit**: 5 - 4 = **1 full scholarship** ‚úÖ

### System Gets 1 Scholarship Every Time:
**4 agents complete their quota = System earns 1 scholarship**

This is the **system scholarship award** that appears on `/admin/system-scholarship-awards`

---

## üè¢ System-Wide Calculation (Per University + Degree)

### Page: `/admin/system-scholarship-awards`

**Display Format**: Cards (like agent scholarships) but showing system progress

### Card Structure:
```
üè´ Istanbul University - Master's Programs
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 16/20 students (80%)
System Progress: 0.8/1 scholarship
Agents Completed: 3/4 (Agent D needs 1 more student)
Status: In Progress

[View Agent Details] ‚Üí Shows which agents contributed
```

### Calculation Per University+Degree:
1. **Count all approved scholarship applications** for that university+degree
2. **Calculate system scholarships earned**: total_students √∑ university_threshold
3. **Calculate system scholarships due**: (total_students √∑ agent_threshold) √ó surplus_per_agent
4. **Show progress**: current/required for next system scholarship

---

## üî¢ Mathematical Examples

### Example 1: Istanbul University Master's
- **University gives**: 1 per 4 students
- **System gives**: 1 per 5 students  
- **System gets 1 scholarship when**: 4 agents √ó 5 students = 20 students total

**Progress Tracking** (ALL students count toward system total):
- 0-4 students: 0% (0/20) 
- 5 students: 25% (5/20) - Agent A completed (gets scholarship)
- 7 students: 35% (7/20) - Agent E has 2/5 (contributes but no scholarship yet)
- 10 students: 50% (10/20) - Agent B completed (gets scholarship)  
- 13 students: 65% (13/20) - Agent F has 3/5 (contributes but no scholarship yet)
- 15 students: 75% (15/20) - Agent C completed (gets scholarship)
- 20 students: 100% (20/20) - **System earns 1 scholarship!** (regardless of individual agent status)

### Example 2: Harvard University Bachelor's  
- **University gives**: 1 per 3 students
- **System gives**: 1 per 5 students
- **System gets 1 scholarship when**: 3 agents √ó 5 students = 15 students total

**System earns**: 15 √∑ 3 = 5 scholarships from university  
**System gives**: 3 scholarships to agents  
**System profit**: 5 - 3 = **2 scholarships** (bigger margin!)

---

## üìã System Scholarship Award Tracking

### Database Logic:
```sql
-- For each University + Degree combination
SELECT 
    university_id,
    degree_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_approved_students,
    (COUNT(*) / university_threshold) as scholarships_from_university,
    (COUNT(*) / agent_threshold) as scholarships_to_agents,
    ((COUNT(*) / university_threshold) - (COUNT(*) / agent_threshold)) as system_profit_scholarships
FROM scholarship_points 
WHERE status = 'active' 
GROUP BY university_id, degree_id
```

### Progress Calculation:
```
students_needed_for_next_system_scholarship = 
    CEIL(total_students / (agent_threshold * agents_per_system_scholarship)) * 
    (agent_threshold * agents_per_system_scholarship) - total_students

progress_percentage = 
    (total_students % (agent_threshold * agents_per_system_scholarship)) / 
    (agent_threshold * agents_per_system_scholarship) * 100
```

## üéØ Key Insights

### 1. System Always Wins
- Every agent scholarship = system profit
- Bigger gap between thresholds = more profit
- System gets scholarships even if individual agents don't complete

### 2. Agents Must Complete Individually BUT Contribute to System Total
- Agent with 4/5 students gets nothing YET
- But their 4 students DO contribute to system total
- If agent completes later (before expiry), they get their scholarship
- System benefits from ALL partial progress

### 3. System Scholarship Inventory
- System accumulates scholarships continuously  
- Admin can convert to applications (both admin and agent use cases)
- Planning: How scholarships convert to applications (future feature)
- Expires with annual cycle (July-November, same as agent points)

### 4. Per University+Degree Tracking
- Each university has different contracts
- Each degree level tracked separately  
- System profit varies by university deal

---

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

### 1. System Scholarship Awards Page
- Card-based layout (like agent scholarships)
- Show progress per university+degree
- Calculate system earnings in real-time
- Click card ‚Üí see contributing agents

### 2. Agent Contribution Details  
- When system scholarship card clicked
- Show which agents contributed students
- Show individual agent progress  
- Show how close to next system scholarship

### 3. Real-Time Calculations
- Update system progress when applications approved
- Show live progress bars
- Notify when system earns new scholarship

---

## ‚úÖ Final Logic Summary

**System Scholarship Formula**:
```
agents_needed = university_threshold / gcd(university_threshold, agent_threshold)
students_per_system_scholarship = agents_needed * agent_threshold
system_scholarships_earned = total_students / students_per_system_scholarship
```

**Example**: University=4, Agent=5
- agents_needed = 4 (since gcd(4,5)=1)  
- students_per_system_scholarship = 4 √ó 5 = 20
- Every 20 students = 1 system scholarship

**This creates a predictable, profitable system where every agent success generates system revenue!**

---

## üéØ Detailed Scenario: Mixed Agent Progress

### Istanbul University Master's (4‚Üí5 threshold)
**System needs 20 total students for 1 scholarship**

### Timeline Example:
```
Month 1: Agent A gets 5 students ‚Üí Completes! Gets scholarship ‚úÖ
         System progress: 5/20 (25%)

Month 2: Agent B gets 3 students ‚Üí Partial progress
         Agent C gets 2 students ‚Üí Partial progress  
         System progress: 10/20 (50%)

Month 3: Agent B gets 2 more ‚Üí Total 5 ‚Üí Completes! Gets scholarship ‚úÖ
         Agent D gets 4 students ‚Üí Partial progress
         System progress: 19/20 (95%)

Month 4: Agent E gets 1 student ‚Üí 
         System progress: 20/20 (100%) ‚Üí **System earns 1 scholarship!** ‚úÖ

Final Status:
- Agent A: ‚úÖ Has scholarship (earned month 1)
- Agent B: ‚úÖ Has scholarship (earned month 3)  
- Agent C: ‚ùå Still has 2/5 (can complete later if time allows)
- Agent D: ‚ùå Still has 4/5 (can complete later if time allows)
- Agent E: ‚ùå Still has 1/5 (can complete later if time allows)
- System: ‚úÖ Earned 1 scholarship from 20 total students
```

### Key Points:
1. **System gets scholarship at 20 students regardless of agent status**
2. **Agents C, D, E can still complete before November 30 expiry**
3. **If they complete, they get scholarships from admin inventory**
4. **If they don't complete by Nov 30, their points expire but system keeps the scholarship**

---

## üìÖ Annual Cycle Integration

### July 1: New Cycle Starts
- All agent points reset to 0/5
- All system progress resets to 0/20  
- Previous system scholarships moved to admin inventory

### During Cycle (July 1 - November 30):
- Agents accumulate points individually
- System tracks total across all agents
- System earns scholarships at threshold intervals
- Agents can complete and claim scholarships anytime

### November 30: Cycle Ends
- All incomplete agent points expire
- System keeps all earned scholarships in inventory
- Admin can convert system scholarships to applications

### December 1 - June 30: Off Season
- No new applications accepted
- Admin manages scholarship inventory
- Planning for next cycle

**This creates a predictable, profitable system where every student contributes to system revenue, and the annual cycle ensures fresh starts while preserving system gains!**

## üéì Scholarship to Application Conversion

### Core Concept
When an agent has earned a scholarship, they can convert it to a FREE application for a student.

### Conversion Flow

#### 1. Starting Point: Completed Scholarship
- Agent goes to **Scholarships page** (`/agent/scholarships`)
- Sees **completed/earned scholarships**
- Each earned scholarship has a button: **"Convert to Application"**

#### 2. Conversion Button Requirements
- **Only show for**: `status = 'earned'` scholarships
- **Hide for**: 
  - `status = 'used'` (already converted)
  - `status = 'in_progress'` (not ready yet)
  - `status = 'expired'` (too late)

#### 3. What Happens When Button Clicked

**Step 1: Pre-fill Scholarship Data**
```
Scholarship Contains:
- University ID (locked, from scholarship)
- Degree ID (locked, from scholarship)
- Can use for ANY program at that university+degree
```

**Step 2: Show Student Creation Form**
- **Same form as "Create New Student + Application"**
- **BUT with key differences**:
  
  ‚úÖ **Pre-filled & Locked:**
  - University (from scholarship)
  - Degree level (from scholarship)
  - Commission type = 'scholarship' (auto-set, hidden)
  - Commission amount = 0 (free!)
  
  ‚úÖ **User Must Select:**
  - Program (dropdown filtered by scholarship's university + degree)
  - Student details (if new student)
  - OR select existing student
  - Application details (intake date, documents, etc.)
  
  ‚ùå **Hidden/Removed:**
  - University selector (locked to scholarship)
  - Commission type selector (always scholarship)
  - Commission amount field (always $0)

#### 4. Form Structure

```

#### 5. Backend Logic

**On Form Submit:**
1. **Validate scholarship**:
   - Check scholarship still `status = 'earned'`
   - Check scholarship belongs to this agent
   - Check scholarship not expired

2. **Create student** (if new):
   - Same logic as normal student creation
   - Link to current agent

3. **Create application**:
   - student_id = selected/created student
   - program_id = selected program (must match scholarship university+degree)
   - agent_id = current agent
   - commission_type = 'scholarship'
   - commission_amount = 0
   - status = 'submitted' (or 'pending' - same as normal)

4. **Update scholarship**:
   - status = 'used'
   - used_at = now()
   - Link to created application (scholarship.application_id)

5. **Validation rules**:
   ```php
   // Program must match scholarship
   $program = Program::find($programId);
   if ($program->university_id !== $scholarship->university_id) {
       throw new Exception('Program must be from scholarship university');
   }
   if ($program->degree_id !== $scholarship->degree_id) {
       throw new Exception('Program must be same degree level as scholarship');
   }
   
   // Scholarship must be available
   if ($scholarship->status !== 'earned') {
       throw new Exception('Scholarship not available for use');
   }
   ```

#### 6. Database Changes Needed

**Add to `scholarship_commissions` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE scholarship_commissions 
ADD COLUMN application_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (application_id) REFERENCES applications(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

**This links the scholarship to the application it created.**

#### 7. UI Components Needed

**Component 1: Convert Button on Scholarship Card**
```php
// Only show for earned scholarships
@if($scholarship->status === 'earned')
    <a href="{{ route('filament.agent.resources.scholarships.convert', ['record' => $scholarship->id]) }}" 
       class="convert-button">
        Convert to Application
    </a>
@endif
```

**Component 2: Conversion Form Page**
- Extends existing "Create Student + Application" form
- Pre-fills university + degree (locked)
- Filters programs by scholarship constraints
- Hides commission fields
- Shows scholarship info banner at top

**Component 3: Success State**
```
‚úÖ Scholarship Converted Successfully!

Scholarship #SCHOL-2025-ABC123 has been used to create:
‚Ä¢ Student: John Smith
‚Ä¢ Application: APP-2025-XYZ789 (Harvard MBA)
‚Ä¢ Status: Submitted (waiting for admin review)

The application is FREE - no commission charges!
```

#### 8. Edge Cases to Handle

**Case 1: Scholarship used while form open**
- Lock check before submission
- Show error: "This scholarship has already been used"

**Case 2: Program no longer available**
- Validate program still active
- Show error: "Selected program is no longer available"

**Case 3: Student already has application for this program**
- Check for duplicates
- Show warning: "Student already applied to this program"

**Case 4: Scholarship expired**
- Check expiry date
- Show error: "This scholarship has expired"

#### 9. User Experience Flow

```
Agent Journey:
1. Earns scholarship (5 students approved) ‚úÖ
2. Sees "Convert to Application" button ‚úÖ
3. Clicks button ‚Üí Opens conversion form ‚úÖ
4. Form shows scholarship is locked to Harvard Master's ‚úÖ
5. Agent creates new student (John Smith) ‚úÖ

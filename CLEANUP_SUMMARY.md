## 📝 Notes

### Middle Name Handling
- Hidden field in form (set to `null` by default)
- Still exists in database (`middle_name` column)
- Still works in Student model's `getFullNameAttribute()`
- Can be re-enabled in future if needed

### Avatar Display Logic
- Uses `student.profile_image` relationship in table columns
- Automatically loads related student model
- Fallback to `default-avatar.svg` handled by `defaultImageUrl()`
- No N+1 query issues (relationships eager loaded)

### Component Reuse
- `application-student-info.blade.php` now used in:
  - Agent application view
  - Admin application view
- Single source of truth for student info display
- Easier to update/maintain

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Bulk Avatar Upload**: Upload multiple student photos at once
2. **Avatar Management**: Edit/replace avatar from student details page
3. **Avatar in More Places**: Add to commission reports, payouts, etc.
4. **Name Format Toggle**: Option to switch between "First Surname" and "Surname, First"
5. **Gender Statistics**: Dashboard widget showing gender distribution
6. **Country Statistics**: Most common countries of residence

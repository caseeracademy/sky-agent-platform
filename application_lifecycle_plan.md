# Application Lifecycle - Complete Redesign

## 🎯 Current Problem

The application status flow is messy and confusing. We need a clear, linear workflow that both admins and agents can follow.

---

## 📋 Proposed Application Statuses (In Order)

### 1. **needs_review** 🔍
- **Who**: Super Admin
- **Meaning**: Fresh application waiting for initial review
- **Next**: Admin decides commission type (money/scholarship) and assigns to team
- **Can Update**: Super Admin only
- **Button**: "Review & Assign" → Goes to quick review page

### 2. **submitted** 📝
- **Who**: Agent created, Admin reviewed
- **Meaning**: Application submitted and ready for processing
- **Next**: Admin checks documents, decides if complete or needs more
- **Can Update**: Admin only
- **Buttons**: 
  - "Request Additional Documents" → additional_documents_needed
  - "Mark as Ready to Apply" → waiting_to_apply

### 3. **additional_documents_needed** 📎
- **Who**: Admin requested
- **Meaning**: Application needs more documents from agent
- **Next**: Agent uploads missing documents
- **Can Update**: Admin (request), Agent (upload & resubmit)
- **Agent Button**: "Documents Uploaded - Resubmit" → submitted
- **Admin Button**: "Cancel Request" → submitted

### 4. **waiting_to_apply** ⏳
- **Who**: Admin marked ready
- **Meaning**: Application ready to be sent to university
- **Next**: Admin sends to university
- **Can Update**: Admin only
- **Button**: "Apply to University" → applied

### 5. **applied** 🎓
- **Who**: Admin sent to university
- **Meaning**: Application submitted to university, waiting for offer letter
- **Next**: University responds with offer
- **Can Update**: Admin only
- **Buttons**:
  - "Offer Received" → offer_received
  - "Reject Application" → rejected

### 6. **offer_received** 💌
- **Who**: Admin received offer from university
- **Meaning**: University accepted, offer letter received
- **Next**: Send offer to student, wait for payment
- **Can Update**: Admin only
- **Button**: "Send to Student for Payment" → payment_pending

### 7. **payment_pending** 💰
- **Who**: Admin/Agent sent offer to student
- **Meaning**: Waiting for student to pay university fees
- **Next**: Student pays and provides receipt
- **Can Update**: Admin or Agent
- **Agent Button**: "Student Paid - Upload Receipt" → payment_approval
- **Admin Button**: Same as agent

### 8. **payment_approval** ✅
- **Who**: Agent/Student uploaded payment receipt
- **Meaning**: Payment made, waiting for admin verification
- **Next**: Admin verifies payment
- **Can Update**: Admin only
- **Buttons**:
  - "Verify Payment & Approve" → approved (triggers commission!)
  - "Payment Issue - Back to Pending" → payment_pending

### 9. **approved** 🎉
- **Who**: Admin verified everything
- **Meaning**: Application complete, student enrolled, commission earned
- **Next**: FINAL STATUS (triggers commission calculation)
- **Can Update**: NOBODY (final status, cannot be changed)
- **Triggers**: 
  - Commission creation (if commission_type = 'money')
  - Scholarship point creation (if commission_type = 'scholarship')

### 10. **rejected** ❌
- **Who**: Admin or University
- **Meaning**: Application rejected at any stage
- **Next**: FINAL STATUS
- **Can Update**: NOBODY (final status)
- **No Commission**: Nothing triggered

## 🎨 UI Changes Needed

### Replace Dropdowns with Action Buttons

**Current**: Status dropdown (confusing, allows wrong transitions)

**New**: Context-aware action buttons

**Example for `submitted` status:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current Status: Submitted           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [📎 Request Additional Documents]   │
│ [✅ Mark Ready to Apply]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example for `payment_pending` status (Agent view):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current Status: Payment Pending     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [💰 Student Paid - Upload Receipt]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Fields for Applications Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE applications ADD:
- payment_receipt_path VARCHAR(255) NULL
- payment_receipt_uploaded_at TIMESTAMP NULL
- payment_receipt_uploaded_by BIGINT NULL
- payment_verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL
- payment_verified_by BIGINT NULL
- offer_letter_path VARCHAR(255) NULL
- offer_letter_sent_at TIMESTAMP NULL
- university_response_date DATE NULL
- rejection_reason TEXT NULL
- rejected_at TIMESTAMP NULL
- rejected_by BIGINT NULL
```

### New Table: Application Status History
```sql
CREATE TABLE application_status_history (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    application_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    from_status VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    to_status VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    changed_by_user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT NULL,
    metadata JSON NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (application_id) REFERENCES applications(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (changed_by_user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## 🔔 Notification Strategy

| Status Change | Notify Who | Message Template |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| needs_review → submitted | Agent | "Application {APP} reviewed and assigned to {ADMIN}" |
| submitted → additional_documents_needed | Agent | "⚠️ Additional documents required for {APP}" |
| additional_documents_needed → submitted | Admin | "📎 Agent uploaded documents for {APP}" |
| waiting_to_apply → applied | Agent | "✈️ Application {APP} sent to {UNIVERSITY}" |
| applied → offer_received | Agent | "🎉 Offer letter received for {APP}!" |
| offer_received → payment_pending | Agent | "💰 Send offer to student for payment" |
| payment_pending → payment_approval | Admin | "💳 Payment receipt uploaded for {APP}" |
| payment_approval → approved | Agent | "🎉 Application {APP} APPROVED! Commission earned!" |
| * → rejected | Agent | "❌ Application {APP} rejected: {REASON}" |

## ✅ Questions ANSWERED

1. **Q: Scholarship Status** ✅ ANSWERED
   - **Answer**: Use existing `commission_type='scholarship'`, NOT a separate status
   - **Action**: Keep status flow same for both money and scholarship applications

2. **Q: Documents Updated Status** ✅ ANSWERED
   - **Answer**: YES, skip it and go directly to "submitted"
   - **Action**: additional_documents_needed → submitted (no intermediate status)

3. **Q: Admin Rejection** ✅ ANSWERED
   - **Answer**: Admin can reject from ANY status (except approved/rejected)
   - **Action**: Show "Reject" button on all non-final statuses

4. **Q: Waiting to Apply → Applied** ✅ ANSWERED
   - **Answer**: Admin manually decides when to apply (reviews applications first)
   - **Action**: Keep manual "Apply to University" button

5. **Q: Approved is Final** ✅ ANSWERED
   - **Answer**: NO changes after approved, BUT need double-approval to prevent accidents
   - **Action**: Add confirmation step before final approval

---

## 🔒 Double Approval System (NEW)

### Problem
Accidental approvals can't be reversed and trigger irreversible commission payments.

### Solution: Two-Step Approval

**Step 1: Pre-Approval** (Status: `payment_approval`)
```
Admin clicks: "Verify Payment"
↓
Modal: "Payment verified. Ready for final approval?"
[Cancel] [Mark as Ready for Approval]
↓
Status changes to: ready_for_approval (NEW STATUS)
```

**Step 2: Final Approval** (Status: `ready_for_approval`)
```
Admin clicks: "FINAL APPROVE"
↓
Big Warning Modal: 
"⚠️ FINAL APPROVAL - THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE
This will:
• Mark application as complete
• Trigger commission payment ($XXX or scholarship point)
• Send approval notification to agent
• Close this application permanently

Are you absolutely sure?"
[Cancel] [🔒 FINAL APPROVE - CONFIRM]
↓
Status changes to: approved (FINAL, IRREVERSIBLE)
Commission triggered ✅
```

### Updated Status Flow (with Double Approval)

```
...
payment_pending
     ↓
payment_approval (Receipt uploaded)
     ↓
ready_for_approval (Payment verified, ready for final step) ⭐ NEW
     ↓
approved ✅ (FINAL - Commission triggered)
```

## 🔒 Safety Features

### 1. Double Approval
- Payment verified → ready_for_approval (reversible)
- ready_for_approval → approved (FINAL, big warning)

### 2. Rejection from Anywhere
- Admin can reject at any stage (except approved/rejected)
- Requires rejection reason
- Logs who rejected and why

### 3. Status History
- Every status change logged
- Who changed it, when, why
- Audit trail for disputes

### 4. Permission Enforcement
- Agent can ONLY update 2 transitions
- Admin has full control (except final statuses)
- System enforces rules

---

## 🎯 Final Clarifications & Decisions

### ✅ Confirmed Decisions:

1. **Commission Type NOT Status**
   - Scholarship applications use `commission_type='scholarship'`
   - Follow same status flow as money applications
   - Only difference: $0 commission vs $XXX commission

2. **Skip "documents_updated" Status**
   - Direct transition: additional_documents_needed → submitted
   - Agent clicks "Resubmit" → immediately goes to submitted
   - No intermediate status needed

3. **Rejection Rules**
   - Admin can reject from ANY status
   - EXCEPT: Cannot reject from `approved` or `rejected` (already final)
   - Always requires rejection reason

4. **Manual Application to University**
   - Admin reviews applications in `waiting_to_apply` status
   - Admin manually clicks "Apply to University" when ready
   - Could be individual or batch (future feature)

5. **Double Approval for Safety**
   - Step 1: payment_approval → ready_for_approval (verify payment)
   - Step 2: ready_for_approval → approved (FINAL with big warning)
   - Prevents accidental approvals
   - Commission only triggers on `approved`

---

## 🔐 Critical Safety Rules

### Rule 1: No Reversing Approved
- Once `approved`, status is LOCKED forever
- Commission already paid/scholarship already given
- Cannot go back (would cause financial issues)

### Rule 2: Double Confirmation
- `ready_for_approval` can go back to previous statuses (reversible)
- `approved` requires BIG scary confirmation modal
- Modal shows exact commission amount that will be paid

### Rule 3: Rejection Requires Reason
- Every rejection must have a reason
- Logged in status history
- Sent to agent in notification

### Rule 4: Agent Limited Updates
- Agent can ONLY update:
  - additional_documents_needed → submitted (resubmit docs)
  - payment_pending → payment_approval (upload receipt)
- Everything else is admin-only

---

## 📊 Status Comparison: Before vs After

### BEFORE (Current - Messy)
```
submitted → approved (too direct, no steps)
Various statuses with unclear flow
Dropdown allows any status change
No approval safety
```

### AFTER (Proposed - Clean)
```
needs_review → submitted → waiting_to_apply → applied → 
offer_received → payment_pending → payment_approval → 
ready_for_approval → approved ✅

Clear linear flow
Action buttons (not dropdown)
Double approval safety
Full audit trail
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases to Handle

### Case 1: Student Doesn't Pay
- Status: payment_pending
- Action: Admin can reject with reason "Student did not pay"
- Result: Application rejected, no commission

### Case 2: Fake Payment Receipt
- Status: payment_approval
- Action: Admin clicks "Payment Issue" → back to payment_pending
- Agent must provide correct receipt

### Case 3: University Delays Response
- Status: applied
- Wait time: Indefinite (no automatic rejection)
- Admin can manually reject if too long

### Case 4: Multiple Document Requests
- Flow: submitted → additional_documents_needed → submitted → additional_documents_needed (again)
- Allow: YES (no limit on cycles)
- Track: History shows all cycles

### Case 5: Commission Already Paid
- If somehow approved → rejected attempted
- System: BLOCKS the change
- Error: "Cannot reject approved application - commission already paid"

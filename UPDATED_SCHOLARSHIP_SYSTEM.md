# Updated Scholarship System - No Money, Combined Form

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **✅ BEFORE (Old System):**
- **Two separate sections** in university form
- **Money/financial tracking** ($1000, $500, etc.)
- **Complex structure** with separate agent and system requirements

### **✅ AFTER (New System):**
- **ONE combined section** in university form
- **No money references** - just scholarship counts
- **Simplified structure** with both requirements in same row

---

## 📋 **New University Form Structure**

### **Single "Scholarship Requirements" Section:**
For each degree type, you set:

| Degree Type | Min Students for Agent Scholarship | Min Agent Scholarships for System |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Bachelor    | 5                                | 4                                |
| Master      | 8                                | 3                                |
| PhD         | 12                               | 5                                |

**Meaning:**
- **Agent**: Gets 1 scholarship after 5 approved Bachelor applications
- **System**: Gets 1 scholarship after 4 agents earn Bachelor scholarships

## 🎓 **How It Works Now**

### **Example: Harvard University - Bachelor Degree**
- **Agent Requirement**: 5 approved students = 1 scholarship
- **System Requirement**: 4 agent scholarships = 1 system scholarship

### **Agent Progress:**
```
Agent John: 
- Applications: ████████░░ 8/5 (Eligible!)
- Scholarships Earned: 1 ✅
- Next scholarship: Needs 2 more students (10 total)

Agent Sarah:
- Applications: ███░░░░░░░ 3/5 
- Scholarships Earned: 0
- Next scholarship: Needs 2 more students
```

### **System Progress:**
```
Harvard Bachelor Scholarships:
- Agent scholarships earned: ████░ 4/4 (Milestone reached!)
- System scholarships earned: 1 ✅
- Next system scholarship: Needs 4 more agent scholarships
```

## 🔄 **Automatic Process**

### **When Application Gets Approved:**
1. **Check Agent Progress**: Did agent reach 5 students?
2. **Award Agent Scholarship**: Create scholarship record (no money amount)
3. **Check System Progress**: Did 4 agents earn scholarships?
4. **Award System Scholarship**: Create system scholarship record (no money amount)

### **Dashboard Display:**
